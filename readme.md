LibEx project
=============

Just a fun C++ helper library for myself.

Source code is divided in 'parts' under the public folder, just include the lib.cpp of the part you want to use.
Documentation for each part should eventually be added in their specific folder some time later.
NOTE: Do not expect this stuff to work! It's all still very early WIP/Incomplete.
